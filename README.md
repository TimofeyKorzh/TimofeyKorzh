My name is **Timofey Korzhebin**. Currently I'm a software engineer student at NRNU MEPhI, Moscow, Russian Federation. I am interested in machine learning research, generative models, IoT and self-hosted solutions.

###  List of technologies

My main programming language is Python 3, because it has extremely useful and comfortable frameworks for machine learning. I prefer Pytorch, but I am familiar with frameworks for classical methods (linear regression, gradient boosting, SVM, naive Bayesian e.g.) like Sci-kit learn and other deep learning frameworks like Keras too as well. I use Google Colab and Kaggle in order to train the models and AWS to host them in production. Also you can check out my [Kaggle account](https://www.kaggle.com/xxxnabigatorxxx).
